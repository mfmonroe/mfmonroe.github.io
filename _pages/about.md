I am a second-year PhD student in the [CS theory group](https://www.colorado.edu/cs-theory/) at the University of Colorado, Boulder, co-advised by [Bo Waggoner](https://bowaggoner.com/) and [Rafael Frongillo](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~raf/). I hold undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Maryland, and before grad school I was a software engineer for Amazon Web Services.

My research interests lie at the intersection of algorithmic game theory and theoretical machine learning, especially related to the aggregation of preferences/information and the incentive structures that arise. 
In particular, I am studying how to make collective decisions by combining preferences and predictions. I am also thinking about how people strategize in different types of forecasting competitions.
